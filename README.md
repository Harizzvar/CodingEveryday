# Challenge: Coding Everyday! 🚀📈

Not your usual 100 Days of Code—this is something different.
Instead of sticking to just one platform or one type of problem, I’m pushing myself to code every other day, explore various platforms, learn new techniques, and optimize my problem-solving approach. And what better way to stay accountable than documenting it here? ✍️💪

Why take on this challenge? Because why not?
Ask a mountain climber, "Why are you climbing the mountain?"
He'd simply say, "Because there's a mountain."
So here I am climbing my own mountain. And the only way forward is up. ⛰️
